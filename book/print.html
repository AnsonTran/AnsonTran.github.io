<p>University of Toronto Scarborough<br />
Introduction to Clinical, Developmental, Personality and Social Psychology<br />
Winter 2020</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#general-course-information" id="general-course-information">General Course Information</a></h2>
<p>This course is the second part of Introduction to Psychology. Along with PSYA01, this course provides students
with an overview of the foundational aspects of psychological science. In PSYA02, we will continue covering
some of the basic building blocks of psychology, such as intelligence, emotion, social psychology, and personality.
We?ll also spend some time discussing developmental change across the lifespan. Finally, we?ll finish the term
by exploring atypical patterns in psychology, including psychological disorders and the treatment of them.
We think that there is something for everyone in this course. Even if you don?t think that you have thought deeply
about psychology before, we in fact are all amateur psychological scientists, constantly pondering and analyzing
our own psychological states and those of others around us. We hope that you will find aspects of this course to
be applicable to and enriching of your daily lives. </p>
<p>After you finish the PSYA01 and PSYA02 sequence of courses, you?ll be prepared to dive further into psychological
science at the B level. We hope that, after this experience, you?ll be motivated to do so!</p>

<p>Martin takes the same personality quiz seven times. Each time, he gets a different result.
What is a characteristic of this quiz?</p>
<ul>
<li>High validity</li>
<li>Low validity</li>
<li>High reliability</li>
<li>Low reliability</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Low reliability</p>

<p>In the whole population, which of the following personality traits is likely to be most highly
correlated with the trait &quot;helpful&quot;?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Uncooperative</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a class="header" href="#personality" id="personality">Personality</a></h2>
<p>Personality is an individual's characteristic of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Behaviour</li>
<li>Thought</li>
<li>Feeling</li>
</ul>
<p>Personalities are relatively stable throughout our lifetimes. We can somewhat predict what someone
will be like when they're old based on what their personality is now.
Even though the way we act towards a group of friends may be different from how we act in a
professional setting, there are a lot of similarities between them.</p>
<p>We study personalities using two different approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Idiographic approach - individual differences (each person)</li>
<li>Nomothetic approach - common trends in the population</li>
</ul>
<p>We study two components of personalities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Describing personality:
<ul>
<li>Characteristics of a person</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Explaining personality:
<ul>
<li>Why doesnt everyone have the same personality?</li>
<li>Not just 'why im introverted', but 'what causes me to be introverted'</li>
<li>Personality theories</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#measuring-personality" id="measuring-personality">Measuring personality</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Observe an individual's personality
<ul>
<li>put people in a certain situation and see how they behave</li>
<li>observe people in their day-to-day life</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Naturalistic observation - Observe people in their day-to-day life
Demand characteristics - People watching alters their behaviour</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#personality-inventories-testsscales" id="personality-inventories-testsscales">Personality Inventories (tests/scales)</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>People self-report their behaviour</li>
<li>People know themselves better and can share their thoughts and feelings, usually hidden</li>
<li>Personality tests should be administered by people who are trained</li>
<li>The way the tests are administered, the interpretation, can affect the results</li>
<li>Social Desirability Bias - Want to answer in a way that is socially acceptable</li>
</ul>
<p>Types of questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes/no questions</li>
<li>Scalar questions 1-10</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Question options are not exhaustive (may not find an answer that applies to them)</li>
<li>Barnem Effect - Descriptions are so vague that everyone can see themselves in that situation</li>
<li>Don't know what the tests are trying to measure</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#validity" id="validity">Validity</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>High validity - measure the psychological construct they are designed to measure</li>
<li>Compare with other tests that are old and validated</li>
<li>Look at whether people actually portray what results we give them</li>
<li>MMPI is widely reliable, clinically valid personality test - contains lots of true/false/cant answer questions</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#reliability" id="reliability">Reliability</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Take the same multiple choice many times, but get different answer
<ul>
<li>Consistency of results</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Blood tests are 100% reliable</li>
<li>Psychological tests are never 100% reliable, because personalities change from state to state</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#mmpi-test" id="mmpi-test">MMPI Test</a></h2>
<p>Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory(MMPI) is a widely reliable, clinically valid personality test

<ol>
<li>Individuals rate themselves on hundreds of traits</li>
<li>Highly correlated traits are combined into factors (outgoing -&gt; extrovertedness)</li>
<li>No correlation between traits are separate factors</li>
</ol>
<p>Researches grouped them into five factors that have very little correlation <strong>OCEAN</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Openness
<ul>
<li>High: Creative, artisitic, curious, imaginative, nonconforming</li>
<li>Low:  Conventional, down-to-earth</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Conscientiousness
<ul>
<li>High: Ambitious, organized, realiable</li>
<li>Low:  Unreliable, lazy, casual, spontaneous</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Extraversion
<ul>
<li>High: Talkative, optimistic, social, affectionate</li>
<li>Low:  Reserved, comfortable with being alone, introverted</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Agreeableness
<ul>
<li>High: Good-natured, trusting, supportive</li>
<li>Low:  Rude, uncooperative, irritable, hostile, competitive</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Neuroticism
<ul>
<li>High: Worried, insecure, anxiety-prone</li>
<li>Low:  Tranquil, secure, emotionally stable</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Neuroticism is reverse-coded, i.e. its better to score lower than higher</p>
<p>Personality traits are relatively stable and stability increases across the lifetime</p>
<ul>
<li>People age 11 compared to themself at age 6 are highly correlated</li>
<li>People age 39 compared to themself at age 30 are even more highly correlate</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rank-order</strong>: &quot;If in a sample of 100 people, you ranked highest in openness, it is likely that
you will be among the highest in openness among the general population as well&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Mean-level Changes</strong>: As a group of people in a certain age group i.e. 20-30, everyone's
traits change similarly, so rank-order doesnt change</p>
<p><strong>Intraindividual Change</strong>: Significant changes in a person's personality from one time to the next</p>
<ul>
<li>Occurs after life-changing experiences, including trauma.</li>
<li>Changes the person's rank-order in the population.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Personality States</strong>: Although personality traits are stable and remain consistent, personality states
may alter the way we express them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Associations</li>
<li>Activities</li>
<li>Mood</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#biological-approach" id="biological-approach">Biological Approach</a></h2>
<p>Traits takes a very biological approach to describing personalities.
Genetics is the largest <strong>single</strong> factor</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Trait Dimension</th><th>Heritability</th></tr></thead><tbody>

<p><strong>Herability Factor</strong>: A range [0,1] that indicates how much of a factor genetics
influences a trait. 0 means no influence, 1 means completely responsible for the trait</p>
<p><strong>Temperament</strong>: Infant's characteristic activity level, mood, attention span, and
distractability.</p>
<ul>
<li>Infant's temperament is predictive of adult personalities</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WEIRD</strong>: Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic</p>
<ul>
<li>Most research on Big Five are conducted in WEIRD cultures</li>
<li><strong>Prevalence</strong> of personality traits <em>does</em> vary from culture to culture</li>
<li>Culture may play a role in determinating an individual's personality</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#behaviourist-approach" id="behaviourist-approach">Behaviourist Approach</a></h2>
<p>The next four approaches to describing personality focus on experiences</p>
<p><strong>Behaviourism</strong>: Produce, reinforce, and repeat a behaviour</p>
<ul>
<li>Training a dog, or lab rats to do something when blowing a whistle</li>
<li>Behaviourists believe that the same principle applies to human personality
<ol>
<li>A human produces a behaviour (smiling at a peer)</li>
<li>Behaviour is reinforced - something good happens as a result (the peer becomes friendly)</li>
<li>Behaviour is repeated (person smiles more often)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#social-cognitive-approach" id="social-cognitive-approach">Social-Cognitive Approach</a></h2>
<p>In this approach, personality is how we deal with situations encountered in daily life</p>
<ul>
<li>How we <strong>construct</strong> situations in our own minds</li>
<li>How we <strong>respond</strong> to those situations
Distinct from trait approach, in which people behave the same way across mosts situations</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Person-Situation Controversy</strong>: Personality is defined more by the situation we're in instead of traits</p>
<ul>
<li>Introverted people do not spend much more time alone than extroverted people do</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Situation-Dependent</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Would you speed while driving?</li>
<li>Would you rob a bank?
Both are likely governed by agreeableness, but an agreeable person is more likely to speed than to rob a bank</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Personal Constructs</strong>: The way in which we organize people in our lives</p>
<ul>
<li>Resonsible</li>
<li>Outgoing</li>
<li>Lazy</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Outcome Expectancies</strong>: How we expect a behaviour to bring us <strong>closer</strong> or <strong>further</strong> from our goals</p>

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Hysteria - Exagerrated or uncontrollable emotion or excitement</p>

<p>Psychodynamic theory extends from Freud's approach</p>
<ul>
<li>Personality is formed by needs, strivings, and desires largely operating <strong>outside of awareness</strong></li>
<li>Motives that can also produce emotional disorders</li>
<li>Called the <strong>dynamic unconscious</strong>

</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="header" href="#psychodynamic-theory" id="psychodynamic-theory">Psychodynamic Theory</a></h3>
<p>Freud divided this dynamic (un)conscious into three parts</p>
<ul>
<li>Id - unconscious, animal desires</li>
<li>Ego - more conscious, control animalistic desires, for life's practical demands
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Conflicts between the three parts cause <strong>anxiety</strong>
To resolve this anxiety, we rely on <strong>defence mechanisms</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Repression - push thoughts away, ignore, and deny</li>
<li>Rationalization - explain, give motivation for feeling </li>
<li>Reaction formation - acting in way that is opposite of insecurity
<blockquote>
<p>person that is weak starts acting tough and macho</p>

</li>
<li>Projection - criticizing another person for behaving in a way you feel yourself
<blockquote>
<p>having a bad time at a party, and saying someone else looks like they're having a bad time</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Regression - return to a more childish version of yourself</li>
<li>Displacement - take out anger to someone/something that is not the cause of the feeling

<li>Identification - identify with the cause of the negative feelings

<p>Psychological reason for producing an action, primarily driven by emotion.</p>
<p>Emotion changes actions by giving us information about an object, event, or
individual. Also provides instructions on what to do with new information.</p>
<p><strong>Hedonic principle</strong>: All motivation extends from attraction to pleasure and
avoidance of paint. Our primary motivator, for <strong>everything</strong> is pleasure. We

<h1><a class="header" href="#introduction-to-operating-systems" id="introduction-to-operating-systems">Introduction to Operating Systems</a></h1>
<p>The operating system is a software layer between user applications and hardware</p>
<ul>
<li>Turns ugly hardware into abstractions (provides services)</li>
<li>Serves as a resource manager</li>
<li>Serves as a control program (protection)</li>
</ul>
<p>Will focus on three core abstractions and resource management services:</p>
<ul>
<li>Processes and Threads</li>
<li>Memory management</li>
<li>File &amp; I/O systems</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="cscc69/./pictures/os.png" alt="os" /></p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#storage-hierarchy" id="storage-hierarchy">Storage Hierarchy</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Processor registers, main memory, HDD/SDD, cloud services</li>
<li>Registers are fast and close to the CPU, but small in size and expensive to have lots of</li>
<li>Cloud services are a lot slower and far from CPU, but larger in size and cheaper</li>
<li>Caches installed to hide performance differences, in large access-time gaps between two levels
<ul>
<li>DRAM store programs and data during program execution, but is volatile</li>
<li>We copy to cache memory close to the processor</li>
<li>But cache is limited, and cache management is necessary (coherency)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="cscc69/./pictures/storage.png" alt="storage" /></p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#concurrency" id="concurrency">Concurrency</a></h2>
<p>Modern computers are multiprocessors, where CPU and device controllers execute
concurrently and compete for memory cycles.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Memory controller</strong> synchronizes access to shared memory</li>
<li><strong>Hardware Interrupts</strong> used to signal the CPU of some event (disk I/O
complete, network packet arrived, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Traps/Exceptions</strong> signal errors (division by zero) or requests OS
service (system call)
Operating systems are event-driven programs</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#processes" id="processes">Processes</a></h2>
<p>Processes is a program in execution, and contains all states of the program</p>
<ul>
<li>An address space</li>
<li>Set of OS resources</li>
<li>Set of general-purpose registers with current values</li>
<li>Named by process ID (PID)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Independent</strong> processes cannot affect or be affected by other processes
executing in the system (no data sharing)<br />
<strong>Cooperating</strong> processes are not independent. Must communicate with each other
and synchronize their actions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shared memory (fork())</li>
<li>Message passing
<ul>
<li>send(P, msg) - send msg to process P</li>
<li>receive(Q, msg) - receive msg from process Q</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="header" href="#process-data-structures" id="process-data-structures">Process Data Structures</a></h3>
<p>Processes are represented by the OS using a data structure called the Process
Control Block (PCB), which contains all the info about a process when it isnt
running</p>
<ul>
<li>Process state (ready, running, blocked)</li>
<li>Program counter - address of the next instruction</li>
<li>CPU Registers - must be saved at an interrupt</li>
<li>CPU scheduling info - priority in the queue</li>
<li>Page tables - memory management info</li>
<li>I/O status info - list of open files
Processes must share the CPU, and the PCB is everything needed to restore a
process to its hardware configuration when the process was switched out of hardware</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Linux PCB</strong> - defined in /include/linux/sched.h
<img src="cscc69/./pictures/task-struct.png" alt="task_struct" /></p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#state-queues" id="state-queues">State Queues</a></h3>
<p>The OS maintains a collection of queues which represent the state of all
processes in the system (typically one for each state)</p>
<ol>
<li>OS dynamically allocates for a PCB and initializes a process, and places it
in a ready queue</li>
<li>When changing state, PCB is unlinked from one queue and linked into another</li>
<li>Each PCB is requeued according to its state - ready, waiting, etc.</li>
<li>PCB is deallocated when the process terminates</li>
</ol>
<h3><a class="header" href="#context-switch" id="context-switch">Context Switch</a></h3>
<p>Switches the CPU to another process, saving the state of the old process and
loading the saved state of the next process in the ready queue.</p>
<p>Context switching is overhead, and a performance bottleneck, so threads are
used to avoid it</p>
<p>Processes are created using the fork() command</p>
<ul>
<li>Creates a new address space, with a <strong>copy</strong> of the entire contents of
the address space of the parent</li>
<li>Initializes kernel resources to point to the resources used by parent</li>
<li>Resturns twice, child's pid to the parent and &quot;0&quot; to the child which we can use
control flow of each process</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="header" href="#forking-web-server" id="forking-web-server">Forking Web Server</a></h3>
<pre><code class="language-c">while (1) {

</code></pre>
<p><img src="cscc69/./pictures/process-server.png" alt="process-server" /></p>
<p>This concurrent web server forks a new process to handle every call.
However, they all share:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code and data (address space)</li>
<li>Privileges</li>
<li>Resources (files, sockets, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The processes do not share:</p>
<ul>
<li>program counter</li>
<li>stack pointer</li>
<li>registers</li>
</ul>

<h2><a class="header" href="#threads" id="threads">Threads</a></h2>
<p>Separate the two into the concepts of <em>processes</em> and <em>threads</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thread</strong> defines a sequential execution stream within a process</li>
<li><strong>Process</strong> defines the address space and general process attributes (everything but threads of execution)
Threads are bound to a process, processes are containers for at least one thread</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="header" href="#concurrent-thread-server" id="concurrent-thread-server">Concurrent Thread Server</a></h3>

	# Process request
	close(sock);
}
</code></pre>
<p><img src="cscc69/./pictures/pthread.png" alt="pthread" /></p>
<p>Thread scheduler determines when a thread runs using queues. Unlike OS and processes, it is implemented
at user-level in a library.</p>
<ul>
<li>Run queue - Threads currently running (usually one)</li>
<li>Ready queue - Threads ready to run</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="header" href="#bootstrapping" id="bootstrapping">Bootstrapping</a></h1>
<p>A small program, BIOS (Basic Input Output System) is stored in non-volatile
memory in hardware. The BIOS knows how to access simple hardware devices i.e.
disk, keyboard, display.</p>
<p>When starting up, this program:</p>
<ol>
<li>Checks RAM, keyboard, basic devices are installed and funtioning correctly</li>
<li>Scans buses to detect attached devices and configure new ones</li>
<li>Determine boot device (goes down the boot order list or user selects)</li>
<li>Read first sectore from boot device and executes it (bootloader)</li>
<li>Bootloader reads partition table, finds active partition, reads second

<p>exec() does the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stops current process</li>
<li>Loads program into process' address space</li>
<li>Initializes hardware context and args for new program</li>
<li>Places PCB onto the ready queue

<p><img src="cscc69/./pictures/read-syscall.png" alt="read-syscall" /></p>
<ol>
<li>User program calls C lib function with arguments</li>
<li>C lib function arranges to pass args to OS, including syscall identifier</li>
<li>Execute special instruction to trap to system mode</li>
<li>Syscall handler figures out which syscall is needed and calls routine for
that operation</li>
</ol>
<p>Adds extra level of indirection through syscall handler, rather than direct
control flow to called function. Enforce separation of userspace and kernel</p>
<p>Kernel must verify arguments passed to it. For example, sys_write():</p>
<ul>
<li>must check whether fd is a file descriptor of recently opened file</li>
<li>must check if allowed to write to it</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixed number of arguments can be passed to registers. Kernel must copy data from
user space to its own buffers. Result of a syscall is returned in register.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#synchronization" id="synchronization">Synchronization</a></h1>
<p>Processes might want to communite with each other to do certain tasks. A
process is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>independent</strong> if it cannot affect/be affected by other processes executing in the system. No data sharing</li>
<li><strong>cooperating</strong> if not independent. Needs data sharing</li>
</ul>
<p>Cooperating processes can exchange information using either</p>
<ul>
<li>Shared memory (e.g. fork())</li>
<li>Message passing - Send(P,msg) and Receive(Q,msg)</li>
</ul>
<p>High-level Abstractions of the critical section:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Locks</strong> - Very primitive, minimal semantics</li>
<li><strong>Semaphores</strong> - Basic, easy to understand, hard to program with</li>
<li><strong>Monitors</strong> - High-level, ideally language support (Java)</li>
<li><strong>Messages</strong> - Model for communication and sync. Direct application to
distributed systems.</li>

<h2><a class="header" href="#banking-example" id="banking-example">Banking Example</a></h2>
<p>Suppose we write a function to handle withdrawals and deposits to a bank account.
A bank's central server would create separate threads for each action.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int balance = 1000;

int withdraw(acct, amt) {
	balance = get_balance(acct);
	balance = balance - amt;
	put_balance(acct, balance);
	return balance;
}

int deposit(acct, amt) {
	balance = get_balance(acct);
	balance = balance + amt;
	put_balance(acct, balance);
	return balance;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Suppose you withdraw $100 and S.O. deposits $100. What is the account balance?
The problem is, processes can be interleaved, due to context switching.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">// Withdrawing code
balance = get_balance(acct);
balance = balance - amt;

// Context switch, deposit code starts executing
balance = get_balance(acct);
balance = balance + amt;
put_balance(acct, balance);

// Withdrawing code continues
put_balance(acct, balance);
</code></pre>
<p>The problem is that concurrent threads manipulated a shared resource without
synchronization. This causes a <strong>race condition</strong>, where outcome depends on the
order in which accesses take place.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#critical-section" id="critical-section">Critical Section</a></h2>
<p>We identify a section of the code where shared resources are accessed, called the
<strong>critical section</strong>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int balance = 1000;

int withdraw(acct, amt) {
	// Enter critical section
	balance = get_balance(acct);
	balance = balance - amt;
	put_balance(acct, balance);
	// Exit critical section
	return balance;
}

int deposit(acct, amt) {
	// Enter critical section
	balance = get_balance(acct);
	balance = balance + amt;
	put_balance(acct, balance);
	// Exit critical section
	return balance;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This piece of code needs to be synchronized so that only one thread can enter
its critical section at a time. Other processes running concurrently must wait.</p>
<p>For program data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Local variables are not shared - <em>private</em>
<ul>
<li>Each thread has its own stack</li>
<li>Local variables allocated on this private stack</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Global variables and static objects - <em>shared</em>
<ul>
<li>Stored in static data segment, accessible by any thread</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dynamic objects and other heap objects - <em>shared</em>
<ul>
<li>Allocated from heap with malloc/free or new/delete</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We want to design a protocol that satisfies the following properties:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Mutual Exclusion</strong> - If a thread is in CS, no other thread is</li>
<li><strong>Progress</strong> - If no thread in CS and a thread wants to enter CS, it should
be able to enter in definite time.</li>
<li><strong>Bounded waiting</strong> - If some thread wait on CS, there should be a limit on
the number of times other threads can enter CS before this thread is granted
access. (no starvation)</li>
<li><strong>Performance</strong> - Overhead of enter/exit is small with respect to work being
done within it</li>

that the condition is true but not a guarantee once it enters the monitor.
Another process could change the value while the process is queuing up. That's
why the while loop is needed, so the buffer goes back to the waiting queue if the
condition is not satisfied.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#process-scheduling" id="process-scheduling">Process Scheduling</a></h1>
<p>On a CPU, only one process can run at a time. We will need a scheduler that
decides which processes to run. We want a CPU scheduling algorithm that
achieves:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Context switching</strong> - Gives illusion of concurrency (single core)</li>
<li><strong>Fairness</strong> - Each process receives fair share of CPU</li>
<li><strong>Avoid starvation</strong> - Process should get CPU in definite time </li>
<li><strong>Policy enforcement</strong> - Usage policies should be met</li>
<li><strong>Balance</strong> - All parts of the system should be busy</li>
<li><strong>CPU utilization</strong> - Keep the CPU busy all the time</li>
</ul>
<p>Preemptive scheduling is suitable for real-time systems. The CPU can be taken
from a running process and allocated to another</p>
<p>On batch systems, we batch processes together and run them in batches. On these
systems, we want:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Throughput</strong> - Maximize jobs completed per hour</li>
<li><strong>Turnaround time</strong> - Minimize time between submission and completion</li>
<li><strong>CPU utilization</strong> - Keep the CPU busy all the time</li>
</ul>
<p>Non-preemptive scheduling is suitable for batch systems. Once the CPU is
allocated a process, it keeps the CPU until it terminates.</p>

do so?</p>
<p>Of course, we're designing more powerful computers all the time. So a
statement about the limitations of your laptop today may not apply in a

<p>We'll divide our questions about logic between two main topics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Computability</strong> - What question can logic ever solve?</li>
<li><strong>Complexity</strong> - What questions can logic solve efficiently?</li>
</ul>
<p>We will use <em>decision problems</em> to talk about problems we are likely to have to
solve. A problem whose answer is either YES or NO.</p>
<ul>
<li>Given integers x and y, what is \( x^2+y^2 \)? (NOT DECISION PROBLEM)</li>
<li>Given integers x,y,z, is \( z = x^2+y^3 \)? (DECISION PROBLEM)</li>
<li>Given integers x and z, is there an integer y such that \( z = x^2+y^3 \)?
(DECISION PROBLEM)</li>
</ul>
<p>When dealing with a problem, we talk about the problem's inpus. However, we
think of inputs as inputs to a program, and we want to differentiate from it.
We will refer to &quot;input&quot; for a problem as an <strong>instance.</strong> So, an input to a
decision problem would be a <strong>yes instance</strong> or <strong>no instance</strong>.</p>
<p>We will talk about objects that can reasonably be encoded into a computer. i.e.
graphs, tables, not real numbers.</p>

terminate in a finite amount of time and give a solution to that instance.</p>

<p>Modify the single tape turing machine by adding another tape. This is the same as
a single TM, but we can work with multiple strings</p>
<p><img src="cscc63/./pictures/multi-tape-tm.png" alt="Multi-tape TM" /></p>
<p>Say we have the following three strings:</p>
<p>\(01q_1011\)<br />
\(000q_1\)<br />
\(q_11010\)</p>
<p>These can be flattened into one TM:</p>
<p>\(
01q_1011\#
000q_1\#
q_11010
\)</p>
<p>If we shift the string down by one to denote the left-hand-side of the string,
we can make a TM that moves back and forth between the different strings.</p>
<p>\(
$01q_1011\#
000q_1\#
q_11010
\)</p>
<p>Add to \(\Gamma, \dot{\Sigma}\) all symbols of the input alphabet with
\(\dot{}\) above it, \(\#\), and \(\dot{\#}\)</p>
<p>S = &quot;On input \(w = w_1, w_2,...,w_n\)</p>
<ol>
<li>\(\#\dot{w_1}w_2...w_n\#\dot{-}\#\dot{-}\#...\#\)</li>
<li>Move right, read symbols under each tape head</li>
<li>Second pass, move left, update tapes according to M's transition function</li>
<li>If TM encounters \(\dot{\#}\), then it reached an unread blank portion
of the tape. It writes a blank, and shifts all the content right of
\(\dot{\#}\) to the right</li>
</ol>
<p>So, we can emulate multiple tapes with a single-tape TM. However, we have a time
cost. If our string has max length n, moving back and forth along the tape to
update positions take up to n times as many steps.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#non-deterministic-turing-machines" id="non-deterministic-turing-machines">Non-Deterministic Turing Machines</a></h2>
<p>We can also have non-deterministic turing machines, where there are multiple
possible arrows out of a state. We accept if <em>any</em> choice leads to the accepting
state. </p>
<p><img src="cscc63/./pictures/non-deterministic-tm.png" alt="Non-Deterministic TM" /></p>
<p>\(
q_0 $01x \rightarrow $q_101x \rightarrow $xq_21x \rightarrow $xyq_3x
\)</p>
<p>From here, we have two choices to follow:<br />
\($xyxq_1 \rightarrow \) reject<br />
\($xyxq_2 \rightarrow \) accept</p>
<p>We can simulate a non-deterministic TM by performing a breadth-first search on
the configuration tree using multi-tape TMs</p>
<p><img src="cscc63/./pictures/ndtm-sim.png" alt="Non-Deterministic Sim" /></p>
<p><strong>input tape</strong> contains the unaltered input<br />
<strong>simulation tape</strong> simulates some branch of the NTM<br />
<strong>address tape</strong> tells us what branch we're on</p>
<p>Start at the root, follow the first child, second child, third child,...</p>
<ol>
<li>Initially, tape 2, 3 empty, 1 contains input \(w\)</li>
<li>Copy 1 to 2, initialize string on 3 to be \(\epsilon\)</li>
<li>Simulate n on 2, consult 3 for next branch to follow<br />
If branch invalid, go to 4 (also if reject)<br />
Elseif no tape 3 symbol, go to 4</li>
<li>Replace tape 3 string with next string in ordering<br />
Simulate next branch by going to 2</li>
</ol>
<p>So, we can simulate a NDTM with a TM. Similarly, there is a time cost. The
size of the tree can be exponentially large in height, so doing a BFS on a
configuration tree of an NTM can take exponentially longer than the running
time of the NTM.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#ram-model" id="ram-model">RAM model</a></h2>
<p>In the RAM model, each tape cell has an address, we can jump to any address
during computation, and can read memory addresses from the tape to figure out
where to jump. Gives us a regular computer's architecture!</p>
<p>There is a \(n^6\) slowdown however, where n is the length of the string</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#church-turing-thesis" id="church-turing-thesis">Church-Turing Thesis</a></h2>
<p>As we can see, each of the modified turing machines can be simulated with a
single tape TM. So, they all have the same expressive power.</p>
<p>Anything that we can reasonably expect to do with an algorithm can also be
decided using a TM:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Problems that can be solved using algorithms \(\leftrightarrow\) Problems
that can be solved using TMs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can now look at things that TMs can't do, and by this thesis, if a TM can't
do it, then no algorithm can.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-liars-paradox" id="the-liars-paradox">The Liar's Paradox</a></h2>
<p>A statement of the form <strong>&quot;This statement is false.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>If we can encode this paradox into a program under assumption that a problem
is decidable, we can show that there is some flaw in our code, and therefore a
flaw in our assumption.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#decidability" id="decidability">Decidability</a></h2>
<p><strong>Decidable</strong>: A problem that can be solve by a TM or algorithm is decidable.</p>
<p><strong>Recognizable</strong>: A problem is recognizable if we can build a TM that will
accept exactly the set of its yes-instances, and loop on some of its
no-instances.</p>
<p><strong>Co-recognizable</strong>: A problem is co-recognizable if we can recognize all of
the no-instances, and loop on some of its yes-instances. We can prove
co-recognizability by writing a recognizer for the complement of the language a
problem accepts.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#a_tm---langle-mw-rangle--textm-accepts-w-" id="a_tm---langle-mw-rangle--textm-accepts-w-">\(A_{TM} = \{ \langle M,w \rangle | \text{M accepts w} \}\)</a></h1>
<p>This turing machine accepts the language of accepting turing machines.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#recognizability" id="recognizability">Recognizability</a></h2>
<p>Trivially, we can see that this language is recognizable. We can build the
following TM to recognize this language:</p>
<p>\(A\) = &quot;On input \(\langle M,w \rangle \)&quot;</p>
<ol>
<li>Run \(M\) on \(w\)</li>
<li>If M accepts, accept</li>
<li>If M rejects, reject</li>
</ol>
<p>However, this machine loops on input M,w if M loops on w.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#undecidability" id="undecidability">Undecidability</a></h2>
<p>We will do a proof by contradiction. Assume that \(A_{TM}\) can be solved by
some TM \(M_A\)</p>
<p>Use this to build another TM \(D\). \(D\) takes input of the form
\(\langle M \rangle \), where \(M\) is some TM.</p>
<p>\(D\) = On input \(\langle M \rangle\):</p>
<ol>
<li>Run \(M_A\) on the input \(\langle M,\langle M \rangle\rangle\).</li>
<li>If \(M_A\) accepts, reject</li>
<li>Else, accept</li>
</ol>
<p>What we get is a machine that does the following:</p>
<p>\[
D(\langle M \rangle) =
\begin{cases}
\text{if M accepts }\langle M \rangle \text{, reject}\\
\text{if M rejects }\langle M \rangle \text{, accept}
\end{cases}
\]</p>
<p>Now, we run D on the input \(\langle D \rangle\).</p>
<p>\[
D(\langle D \rangle) =
\begin{cases}
\text{if D accepts }\langle D \rangle \text{, reject}\\
\text{if D rejects }\langle D \rangle \text{, accept}
\end{cases}
\]</p>
<p>We have encoded the liar's paradox into this machine. Therefore, our original
assumption that \(M_A\) was decidable is incorrect, and \(A_{TM}\) is
undecidable.</p>
