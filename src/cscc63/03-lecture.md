A language L is recognizable iff:
* For all \\(x \in L \\), there is some checking proof c that x is in L
* For all \\(x \not\in L \\), there is no proof such that \\(x \not \in L\\), though

A language L is co-recognizable iff:
* For all \\(x \not \in L\\), there is some checkable proof c that \\(x \not \in L\\)
* For all \\(x \in L \\), there is no proof that \\(x \not \in L \\)
There may or may not be a proof that \\(x \in L \\), though
