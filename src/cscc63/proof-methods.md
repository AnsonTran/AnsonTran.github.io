# Proof Methods

## Diagonalization Method

Assume we have two sets A, B, and a function mapping A to B.

f is **one-to-one**(injective) if f no two elements in A map to the same element in B.

f is **onto**(surjective) if every element in B is mapped to by at least one element in A.

f is a **correspondence**(bijective) if f is both one-to-one and onto
