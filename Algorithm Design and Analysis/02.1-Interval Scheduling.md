# Interval Scheduling
Given a set of intervals/jobs, find the largest subset of intervals that do not overlap.
* Set of $n$ intervals $[s(i), f(i)]$ where $s(i)$ is the start time of interval $i$, $f(i)$ is the finish time of interval $i$.
**Output**: Max cardinality feasible subset of the input set of intervals

Intervals $i$ and $j$ overlap if $s(i) \leq s(j) \leq f(i)$. A subset solution is "feasible" if no such two intervals exist in the set. In other words, we want the largest subset of intervals, such that no two intervals overlap.

For this problem, we want to sort the intervals in some order so that we can greedily pick intervals to build up the solution.

```c
A := {}
for each interval i in sorted order do
	if i overlaps no interval in A then
		A := A + {i}
return A
```

## Strategy 1: Sort by Start Time
Not a feasible solution. We can construct a set of intervals, for which the strategy would fail. Note that we can stuff as many intervals as we want, meaning we may not be anywhere near an optimal set.

## Strategy 2: Sort by Length
Produces a feasible solution. However, we can also construct a set that shows it is not an optimal strategy.

## Strategy 3: Sort by Number of Conflicts
Produces a feasible solution, but yet again, we can construct a set that shows it is not optimal.

## Strategy 4: Sort by End Time
Sorting by end time is the optimal strategy. Intuitively, choosing the interval with earliest end time, leaves the most time afterwards for other intervals to add to the set.

## Proof: Greedy Stays Ahead
Consider two sets $A$ and $A^*$.
* $A$ is constructed by the greedy algorithm picking intervals by earliest end time
* $A^*$ is some optimal set.
* Let $i_1, i_2,\dots , i_n$ be the intervals in $A$ in left to right order.
* Let $j_1, j_2,\dots , j_m$ be the intervals in $A^*$ in left to right order.
We will show that for $k=1,\dots n, f(i_k) \leq f(j_k)$, through induction.

### Base Case
For the base case, $n=1$. It is trivial that $f(i_1) \leq f(j_1)$, as the earliest end time interval is picked, without having to consider overlapping other intervals.

### Induction Hypothesis
The induction hypothesis assumes for $k=1,\dots,n, f(i_k) \leq f(j_k)$. Prove that the hypothesis holds for $k=n+1$.
$$\begin{align}
f(i_k)&\leq f(j_k) & [\text{by induction hypothesis}]\\
&\leq s(j_{k+1}) & [A^* \text{is feasible and } j's \text{ ordered left to right}]\\
&\lt f(j_{k+1})
\end{align}$$

Notice that $j_{k+1}$ does not overlap with any interval in $A$, and thus is a feasible choise for $i_{k+1}$.

Consider the step when the algorithm adds interval $i_{k+1}$. If there are no feasible choices with finish time before $f(j_{k+1})$, the algorithm will pick $j_{k+1}$ which is itself a feasible choice. Thus, $f(i_{k+1}) \leq f(j_{k+1})$.

### Equal Cardinality
Now, we need to prove that $n=m$. Suppose, for contradiction, that $n \lt m$. We know that $f(i_n) \leq f(j_n)$. However, since $j_{n+1},\dots,j_m$ are all feasible choices, we can extend the size of $A$ so that $n=m$. Therefore, $A$ and $A^*$ have the same max cardinality, and the algorithm is optimal.

## Proof: Promising Set
Consider two sets $A$ and $A^*$.
* $A$ is constructed by the greedy algorithm picking intervals by earliest end time
* $A_t$ is the set contained in $A$ at the end of iteration $t$
**Invariant**: At the end of iteration $t$, $A_t$ is contained in *some* optimal set $A^*$

Consider iteration $t+1$:
1. $A_{t+1}=A_t$, hence $A^*-A_t$ is empty and $A_t$ is an optimal set
2. $A_{t+1}=A_t \cup j$, we must prove that $A_{t+1}$ is in some $A^*$
