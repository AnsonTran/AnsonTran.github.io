# Minimize Max Lateness Scheduling
Given a set of jobs, minimize the max lateness of any job.
* Set of $n$ jobs $1,\dots,n$
* Release time $r$
* Duration $t(i)$ for each job $i$
* Deadline $d(i)$ for each job $i$
**Output**: A schedule $s$ that minimizes the max lateness of any job in $s$

Schedule $s$ specifies the start time $s(i)\geq r$ of each job $i$ such that no two jobs overlap:
$$\forall i\neq j, [s(i),s(i)+t(i)] \text{ and } [s(j), s(j)+t(j)] \text{ do not overlap}$$

Given a schedule $s$, the lateness of job $i$ in $s$ is:
$$l(s,i)=\max(0,s(i)+t(i)-d(i))$$

For this problem, we want to minimize the largest lateness of any job in the schedule.
$$l(s)=\max l(s,i), 1\leq i\leq n$$

## Strategy: Sort by Increasing Deadlines
From above, we can make the following observations:
1. For every optimal solution, there is an equivalent solution where there is no gaps. Removing gaps can only cause the max lateness to decrease
2. An inversion of schedule $s$, is a pair of jobs $a$ and $b$, such that $s(a)<s(b)$ but $d(a)>d(b)$.
3. All schedules with no gaps and no inversions have the same lateness

```c
let d[1,...,n] be deadlines sorted
let t[1,...,n] be durations
F := r
for i:= 1 to n do
	gs(i) := F;
	F := gs(i) + t(i)
return gs
```

## Proof: Greedy Stays Ahead
This strategy results in a schedule that has no gaps and no inversions. To prove optimality, it suffices to show that some schedule with no gaps and no inversions is optimal.

Let $s$ be any optimal schedule with no gaps and at least one inversion. This schedule has an inversion involving two consecutive jobs $i$ and $j$. Consider a modified schedule $s'$, that swaps these two jobs.
1. $s'$ has fewer inversions than $s$
2. The lateness of jobs other than $i$ and $j$ is the same in both schedules
3. Lateness of job $j$ decreases by $t(i)$
4. Lateness of job $i$ increases by $t(j)$, but is still less than the lateness of job $j$ in schedule $s$
Hence, the maximum lateness of schedule $s'$ is less than in schedule $s$
