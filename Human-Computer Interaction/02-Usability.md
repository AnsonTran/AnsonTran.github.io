# Usability
Usability is a **quality attribute** that assesses how easy user interfaces are to use. The word "usability" also refers to methods for improving ease-of-use during the design process.

On the Web, usability is a necessary condition for survival. Because of this, companies should spend about 10% of their budgets on usability.
* If a website is difficult to use, people leave
* If the homepage fails to clearly state what a company offers and what users can do on the site, people leave
* If users get lost on a website, they leave
* If a website's information is hard to read or doesn't answer users' key questions, they leave.

> Factors to consider in usability

## Quantitiative Measure
Usability is a phenomenon that can be measured and quantified as a concrete means to judge a design's effectiveness
* How quickly we complete the tasks and how many errors we make in the process

## Qualitative Measure
Usability is a qualitative measure of the experience of using a tool
* How much satisfaction we derive in using a tool
* How quickly we learn to use a tool
* How well we remember how to use it the next time

## Goals and Measures
Systems should promote standardization, integration, consistency, and portability
1. **Standardization** - Using pre-existing industry standards when they exist to aid learning and avoid errors (e.g. the W3C and ISO standards)
2. **Integration** - The product should be able to run across different software tools and packages (e.g. Unix)
3. **Consistency** - Compability should be present between:
	1. Different product versions
	2. Related paper and non-computer based systems
	3. Action sequences, terms, units, colors, etc. within the program
4. **Portability** - Allow the user to convert data across multiple software and hardware environments

## Community Evaluation
The first task in usability is to define the target user community and the class of tasks associated with the interface. Human factors central to community evaluation include:
1. **Time to learn** - How long does it take for typical members of the community to learn relevant tasks?
2. **Speed of performance** - How long does it take to perform relevant benchmarks?
3. **Rate of errors by users** - How many and what kind of errors are made during benchmark tasks?
4. **Retention over time** - Frequency of use and ease of learning help make for better user retention
5. **Subjective satisfaction** - Allow for user feedback via interviews, free-form comments and satisfaction scales

### Physical Abilities
Users have varying physical abilities and needs, so developers must make compromises or create multiple versions of a system. Some of these variances in the population include:
* **Vision** - Depth, contrast, color blindness, motion sensitivity
* **Touch** - Keyboard and touchscreen sensitivity
* **Hearing** - Audio clues must be distinct

### Cognitive and Perceptual Abilities
The journal Ergonomics Abstracts offers this classification of human cognitive processes:
* Long-term and semantic memory
* Short-term and working memory
* Problem solving and reasoning
* Decision making and risk assessment
* Language communication and comprehension
* Search, imagery, and sensory memory
* Learning, skill development, knowledge acquisition, and concept attainment

### Personality Differences
Developers must be aware that populations are subdivided and that these subdivisions have various responses to different stimuli.

The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator identifies the following differences:
* Extroversion vs Introversion
* Sensing vs Intuition
* Perceptive vs Judging
* Feeling vs Thinking

### Cultural and International Diversity
* Characters, numerals, special characters, and diacriticals
* Left-to-right, right-to-left, vertical input and reading
* Date and time formats
* Numeric and currency formats
* Weights and measures
* Telephone numbers and addresses
* Names and titles (Mr., Ms., Mme.)
* Social-security, national identification, and passport numbers
* Capitalization and punctuation
* Sorting sequences
* Icons, buttons, colors
* Pluralization, grammar, spelling
* Etiquette, policies, tone, formality, metaphors

### Users with Disabilities
Designers must plan early to accommodate users with disabilities. Additionally, regulation such as the Disabilities Act help improve support.

### Older Adult Users
As the world's population ages, designers in many fields are adapting their work to serve older adults, which can benefit all users. Designers should allow for variability within their applications via settings for:
* Sound
* Color
* Brightness
* Font sizes
* Less distracting animation

## Guidelines
Low-level focused advice about good practices and cautions against dangers. Based on best practices, guidelines use shared language to promote consistency among multiple designers in:
* Terminology usage
* Appearance
* Action sequences

While they contribute to steady improvements in systems, they are too specific, incomplete, hard to apply, and sometimes wrong.

> Provide a text equivalent for every non-text element
> For any time-based multimedia presentaiton, synchronize equivalent alternatives
> Information conveyed with color should also be conveyed without it
> Title each frame to facilitate identification and navigation

## Principles
Mid-level strategies or rules to analyze and compare design alternatives. They are more fundamental, widely applicable, and enduring than guidelines.

> Determine users skill levels
> Identify the tasks
> 5 primary interaction styles

## Theories
High-level widely applicable frameworks to draw on during design and evaluation, as well as to support communication and teaching. Theories can also be predictive, such as those for pointing times by individuals or posting rates for community discussions.
