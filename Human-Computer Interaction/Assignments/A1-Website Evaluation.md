# Patreon Website Evaluation
Patreon is a fundraising platform, geared towards independent creators. It has a tiered monthly subscription model, where users purchase monthly subscriptions for access to exclusive content. In most cases, higher priced subscriptions contain the perks available in the lower tiers, plus some additional perks.

Patreon also allows creators to interate with their fanbase, through news update posts, and a community tab, where users can leave comments.

To create a new product page, users complete a fill in forms in a series of steps. Clicking on preview, opens a new tab that shows what the page would look like. As the user is filling in the form, clicking the 'Save changes' button will update the checklist.

## Eight Rules
### 1. Strive for consistency.
Since Patreon is a user content driven website, creators need sufficient customization of their product page to sell their product to users. As seen above, every product page on Patreon maintains a consistent layout and style.

In the new version, Patreon-specific styling, such as the red on some buttons and progress bars, have been removed. Instead, creators have the option to chose their own accept color for branding. A black-colored font replaces the light gray font, which does not clash with most other colours.

Page layouts are consistent between all product pages. Creators can modify the contents of each component, but do not control where they are placed on the page. Users are able to navigate to the same areas of the page in order to read about the product, learn about subscription tiers, etc.

### 2. Seek universal usability.
The page building process on Patreon, is very usuable and intuitive. Each field that could potentially be ambiguous, is asked in the form of a question, and gets the user thinking about what they are selling. Examples of potential entries are added in the field itself. If creators are still having trouble designing their page, several articles are presented under the checklist as a guide.

As a result, the page building process is made accessible to all skill levels, as lots of customization is provided, with plentiful descriptions and examples to guide newcomers.

On the product pages, the older version presents content in a main column, supplemented by two additional columns on either side. These contain additional information, such as goals on the left, and subscription tiers on the right.

Issues arise when switching to a mobile view of the site, where supplemental columns are merged into one column on the left. After scrolling past a certain point, the left column becomes empty, and the central column does not reclaim the space. This showcases how a multi-column approach does not suit small screens.

>Content is not centered, once the left column runs out of content

The newer version of the site presents content in one central column. First, users are presented with subscription tiers, an about section, goals, and creator posts. This makes it easier to adjust the margins on either side depending on the size of the screen, and increasing accessibility and transformability of the content.

Patreon provides options to change the language of non-user generated content. Prices can also be changed by the user, which affects the subscription tiers.

### 3. Offer informative feedback.
Patreon provides the user with adequate feedback for interface actions. The search bar presents creators as you type, and actions such as clearing a required field in a form causes the field to turn red. As you complete sections of the page creation process, a checklist is shown to inform the user on which parts of the page are yet to be completed.

### 4. Design dialogs to yield closure.
In the page building process, the checklist provides the user with positive feedback. However, a 'next' button is not present at the bottom of the page, meaning that users must scroll to the top of the page and select the next tab. Adding one would turn the process into a sequence of actions, providing a sense of accomplishment after completing a section.

### 5. Prevent errors.
Patreon prevents errors when filling in forms, by providing error labels below fields. Clicking on the 'Save Changes' button brings the user's attention to the error, allowing them to correct it. Errors are isolated to each component, and do not require the user to retype fields if they get something wrong.

An issue with the page building process, is that changes are not saved without clicking the 'Save Changes' button, or completing all steps in all sections. No confirmation box pops up when leaving the page or moving to another section, meaning users could leave the page without saving their progress.

### 6. Permit easy reversal of actions.
Actions made in the form building process can always be edited by the creator, even after launching their page. Sections of the form do not have to be completed sequentially, and users can move back and forth between them.

### 7. Keep users in control.
Due to the familiar layout of every patreon page, users do not have to learn a new interface when navigating a new page. Components such as posts, subscription tiers, etc. are always in the same place no matter whose product page is being viewed. 

In page building, elements such as a standard text editor are familiar to most users and allows them to produce their desired result.

### 8. Reduce short-term memory load.
The last section of the page building process is a preview page. Creators can make sure the end result meets their requirements, before launching their page, reducing the need to make repeated adjustments to the page. Most steps are short and quick, simplifying the data-entry process.

An issue with Patreon's tiered subscription system, is that a highly priced tier often consists of all benefits from lower tiers, plus a few additional ones. This becomes problematic with an increased number of tiers, as learn the benefits of the top tier requires the user to read all the lower ones.

## Recommendations
### Reduce Short-Term Memory Load
To make it easier for users to decide on a tier to purchase, I would suggest having a short title for each perk, with extra details hidden. To learn more about a tier, clicking 'see details' will expand the card, providing a more in-depth explanation.

Instead of memorizing the details of lower-tier perks, users will have a bullet-point list that they can glance at. This would reduce the memory load for users, and allow them to create a mental list of perks that they are purchasing.

### Prevent Errors
To prevent losing progress on the page, I would add a 'next' button at the bottom of the form. Clicking on it would check for errors on the page, save user progress, and move to the next section. In this case, if the user forgets to click 'save changes', only changes on the current section would be lost. Additionally, I would open up a confirmation dialog if the user exists the page without saving.
