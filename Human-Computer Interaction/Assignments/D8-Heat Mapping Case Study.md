# Heat Mapping Case Study: Epa.gov Homepage
https://digital.gov/2014/08/12/heat-mapping-case-study-epa-gov-homepage/
This case study looks at how heatmaps can be useful in HCI. Heatmaps use color to show what components users are clicking on most, with white indicating the highest level of user interaction. The case study identifies three ways in which heatmaps can aid in the design of the website.
1. Identifying underused sections - Users were scrolling through photos, but didn't know that they could click on the photo to enlarge it
2. Discovering Links of Value - After moving the jobs section to the bottom of the page, it was still getting many clicks, indicating that the change did not obstruct users
3. Measuring Benefits of Heat Mapping - Heatmaps can show user activity a lot better than measuring clicks on individual links

The author of the case study mostly uses qualitative analysis of the heatmaps, inferring user behaviour from what users are clicking on the most and what areas of the page are lacking user engagement. Although they don't look at quantitative data directly, they compare it to context that could be lost when looking at click rate of links. Heatmaps also conveys its message at a glance, compared to other methods.
