# Heuristic Usability Evaluation

## Transit Wait Times
Heuristics violated: H1, H6

The wait times for the various transit modes available at Pearson, must be clicked through. This makes it difficult for people who might want to compare the times between taking the train and taking the bus. Instead of comparing them at a glance, users need to remember all of the departure times of each transport mode as they click through the buttons.

## Inconsistent Buttons, and Headings
Heuristics violated: H4

The Pearson website has an inconsistent use of colors between section labels, and buttons. In the first image, we see the use of a dark blue button to with white text to plan your travel.

However, in the second image, the color uses are inverted. We see the dark blue being used in the title card, and in the text. Instead of the same dark blue button and white text, this scheme is flipped, with a white button and dark blue text. This makes it difficult for users to figure out what parts of the page are interactive.

Some headings also use a different style, which can be confusing for users. Here, the heading is done with black text, instead of the usual blue box.

## Extraneous Information
Heuristics violated: H8

The main page also contains a lot of extraneous information. Here, information about free cancellation is the same size as the main heading label, which competes for the attention of the user.
