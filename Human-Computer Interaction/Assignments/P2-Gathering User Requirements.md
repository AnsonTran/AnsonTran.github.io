## Scenario
### Have saved locations for origin and destination
It's a weekend, and Amy is planning to go on a picnic with her friends. She does not know the exact bus she has to travel with so she goes to YRT for trip planning. She can not count how many times she has typed her home address on the website for planning since her home is always the origin. She wishes she could just set up a profile on YRT and save her home address so she can just autofill it with clicking a button. 

### Post/ Get reviews of bus routes from other users
Suzy wants to go grocery shopping by bus.  She is choosing between 9 o’clock or 5 o’clock. She has to take her kid with them and after shopping she also needs to prepare a meal for her family. She knows buses have the possibility of running late during rush hours, and does not want to  waste time waiting for the late bus and she cannot take over crowded buses since she has infants to take care of. She goes to the YRT website and starts planning the trip.

Therefore, suzy would appreciate this kind of  information provided for each route during different hours. 

### Track bus location and ETA in real-time
Amy has an in-person interview scheduled downtown. She plans to use the YRT bus services from her home in Markham to the TTC subway station. The YRT bus she is taking was scheduled to arrive at her station at 10 am that morning and it would then take around 20 minutes to arrive at the Finch TTC subway station. However, she has been waiting at the bus stop for 20 minutes after the scheduled time and the bus still has not arrived yet. At this point, she should have almost arrived at the TTC subway station. If she does not arrive at the subway station by 10:40 am at the latest, she will be late for her interview. In order to be able to reach the subway on time, she can immediately call an Uber. Therefore, she needs to know where the bus is and when it is going to arrive based on the situation at that time in order to make the decision and not be late for her interview. 

### Trip Planning
After reading flyers in the mail, Tom wants to make a trip to several supermarkets in his area. He visits the YRT website, and begins planning his multi-stop trip. The first option allows him to complete the trip in an hour, but requires a lot of walking in order to reach a connecting bus. Tom would like to reduce the amount of walking on his trip, since he will be carrying groceries that he has purchased. The second route has a bus that comes less frequently, but is fully accessible and less crowded, as it is not along a main street.

### Purchase Tickets Online
Amy gets up late this morning. It is already 9:30 a.m., and she has to arrive at the restaurant she works for before 10 a.m. She gets dressed in a hurry, grabs her bag, and heads to the bus stop. After a 5-minute run, the bus stop is just around the corner. She then realizes that she forgot to bring her PRESTO card, which is left inside the pocket of the jeans that she wore yesterday. A bus is coming to the stop. She takes this bus every Saturday, and she knows it would be a 15-minute route. If she cannot make it onto this bus, she will have to wait for at least 10 minutes for the next one and will definitely be late for work. No!! She doesn’t want a $15 penalty deducted from her salary! Amy would appreciate a simple and quick way for her to purchase a YRT ticket so that she won’t miss the bus. She has probably heard of the YRT pay app, but as this is a one-time purchase, and she is nearly running out of her mobile data this month, she doesn’t want to download an app for this. Therefore, she wants the YRT website to have the feature of purchasing tickets.

## Techniques
There are 3 major ways of Techniques used to gather user requirements.

### Survey
Our major method of gathering user requirements is an online survey via Google Form. It is believed that surveys are easy to distribute, and responses can be collected and analyzed in a database. By conducting online surveys, we are able to gather formatted responses from a large population within a short time. The time cost for data analysis can also be reduced.

### Interview
Senior citizens are also a potential group of users of YRT and they have special requirements and needs. Though we created a field for recording the age of the people who filled out the questionnaire, we decided to conduct offline interviews with them since they might not be that technically advanced. The questions are similar to what is included in the online survey, but fields related to senior citizens should be highlighted.

It is included in the Appendix.

### Observation
Direct observation in the field is also an important technique we used. As some of the behaviors may not be noticed by the participants themselves, surveys and interviews may not give accurate results. By following some users to see how they behave during the time they are using the website, taking notes, and recording videos (when possible), we can record and analyze participants’ behaviors in a more natural environment.

## Users
There are 3 types of users that were identified for the user requirement analysis.

### Users who are frequent commuters 
Users who fall in this category are usually the frequent users of the YRT website. Their education or work require them to commute on a daily basis. As a result, the YRT services and their website are very integrated with their life and they are very familiar with the YRT platform. These users will in turn know what’s best for the typical user of the website. Therefore, they would be able to provide accurate and valuable insight into the needs and wants of most users.

For this category of users, 35 users were selected. An online survey was sent to all and they provided insight towards our design. Since this is the most representative group of users for the website and most were willing to facilitate the research, the most users were selected from this category. 

### Pregnant mothers who commute with their kids all the time
Users who fall into this category may not be as frequent users of the YRT website, but still need to access the site in order to find information about buses. Due to being pregnant and traveling with kids, they may not be able to drive and would need to rely on the YRT services and website. This also results in being able to provide a unique outlook on the needs and wants of similar types of users that would use the website.

For this category, only 5 users were selected due to how scarce this type of user is. We interviewed the mother and child and asked them questions about the website. Since this is a small subset of users for the website and we did not want to intrude, the fewest users were selected from this category.

### Citizens who are older and less mobile
Users who fall into this category are the second major part of the users of the YRT website. 

Seniors’ bodies deteriorate with age, which can make them less mobile and lead to difficulty driving on their own. They tend to make fewer journeys if they cannot afford convenient transportation. As a result, these users are likely to choose public transport for their daily life and the YRT services and websites would be an essential tool to increase their quality of life. In addition, based on one report from York Region, the senior’s population is growing fastest among other age groups, and it’s predicted that the population of seniors will account for 1/5 of the total residents in 2031 (Seniors Strategy, 2021). As the population of those users are increasing, the needs of the YRT services and website would be increased. 

  

For this category of users, 21 users were selected since these users don’t not have a fixed traveling time. We interviewed seniors with select questions from our survey. In addition, we asked them to take a look at our low-fidelity prototypes, since they are usually not familiar with technology. As a result, they are also the best target users to test our design’s learnability.

## Artifacts
Survey Form: [https://forms.gle/KVtYtL2ncNDrqB247](https://forms.gle/KVtYtL2ncNDrqB247) 
Interview Questions: Appendix 2.1

## Summary of results
By conducting a survey using Google forms, we have collected 61 valid responses in total. The survey covers participants who live in or occasionally visit the York region from different age groups: 5 children (0-14 years old), 28 youths (15-24 years old), 23 adults (25-64 years old), and 5 seniors (65 years old and above). 

### For creating and modifying user profiles:
According to the survey results, roughly 80% of responses said they were willing to register an account with the website in order to save user information, with about 65% of the yes responses choosing Google as their preferred 3rd party sign up option. Only 15% of yes responses chose Facebook, with the other 20% choosing either both or neither of the two. Surprisingly, there was a decent amount of people that filled in Twitter for the “other” option, and a couple other options such as Discord and Reddit showing up too. When it comes to the input component for enabling a dark mode feature, it had an overwhelming 95% of responses choosing the slider option. Taking all of this into consideration, we can move forward with certain design choices like the slider when creating high fidelity prototypes and having a user profile. We can also consider certain design changes such as adding in Twitter as a new sign up option, and/or having a new option to replace Facebook.

### For Get/submit Route Review:
According to the results collected from the survey, 27% percent of respondents claim that they identify themselves as customers with disabilities, the elderly or pregnant women. As they are mandatory to provide a response to the last question regarding the need to get additional information such as punctuality rate, congestion degree, or text review. The results indicate that 70% and 65% of responses show the need for punctuality rate and congestion degree respectively, while only 23% claim they also need additional text review. Based on this situation, we believe this feature should be added to the website while the text review section is no longer needed. 

Interviews are also conducted with senior citizens who are not likely to have a chance to fill out the online form. As they are not really technologically advanced, only 12% of the interviewee said they have used the YRT website and only 1 senior said he uses the website frequently for trip planning, however, he gave negative feedback regarding creating profiles on the website but still willing to provide information of specific buses. Taking this into consideration, we should modify our design to enable guests to rate a route.

### For tracking bus location and ETA in real-time:
According to the survey results, around 91% of participants claim that they are frequent users of the YRT bus services. Of them all, 20% claim that they use the YRT website frequently (3+ days a week) and they all use it to check for the scheduled arrival time of the bus that day. However, from the responses, 60% of participants claimed that they always experience late arrivals from the YRT buses (20+ minutes after scheduled time). As a result, the bus schedule issued from the YRT website does not seem to give users any accurate feedback. This does not necessarily mean that the bus schedules are unreasonable but rather traffic on the road is not always predictable. Therefore, creating a real-time bus tracking feature and ETA based on real-time bus location would provide much accurate insight for the user and also improve overall usage of the website, even for frequent users of the YRT bus services.

### For purchasing tickets online:
According to the survey results, all of the 61 participants use a PRESTO card to pay YRT fares, and over 90% of them have the experience that they forgot to bring the card with them when they were taking the YRT. Although the YRT Pay and Transit apps offer the feature of purchasing tickets online, only 12% of the participants know these two apps, and less than 10% of the participants have ever tried using these two apps. For those who know these apps, most of them claim that the apps are hard to use. Some mentioned that they don’t want too many apps on their phone. Nearly 67% of the participants think they would try purchasing tickets on the YRT website if there is such a feature. From these results, we know that the PRESTO card is a generally accepted way to pay YRT fares, but the demand for purchasing tickets online is still widely seen among the participants. Due to the poor popularity and user experience of the YRT apps, we should consider adding the feature to the YRT website. In addition, we must take user experience into consideration and improve the convenience of purchasing tickets using the website.
