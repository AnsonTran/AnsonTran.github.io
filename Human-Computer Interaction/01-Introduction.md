# Introduction
Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is the study of how people interact with computers and to what extend computers are or are not developed for successful interaction with human beings.
1. **Humans** - The user of a computer program, device, or other information technology
2. **Computer** - The physical device, artifact, or hardware that runs the program
3. **Interaction** - The communication between the human and the computer (direct or indirect)

HCI is concerned with designing interactive computing systems for human use, as well as evaluating existing systems.

## History of HCI
* In the beginning, there were humans.
* 1940s - Computers were introduced
* 1945 - Vannevar Bush published "As We May Think" in *The Atlantic Monthly*
* 1962 - Ivan Sutherland develops *Sketchpad*
* 1963 - Douglas Engelbart invents the computer mouse
* 1981 - *Xerox Star* launched
* 1982 - ACM SIGCHI formed
* 1983 - Card, Moran, and Newell publish *The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction*
* 1984 - Apple *Macintosh* launched
* 2007 - 25th Anniversary of "CHI" the SIGCHI annual conference

## First HCI User Study
The first HCI user study was a comparison between the mouse and other input devices.
* 13 participants
* Independent variable - *Input methods* with six levels:
	* Mouse
	* Light pen
	* Grafacon
	* Joystick (position-control)
	* Joystick (rate-control)
	* Knee-controlled lever
* Dependent variables
	* Task completion time (access time + motion time), error rate
* Within-subjects, counterbalanced
* Task
	* Press spacebar
	* Acquire device
	* Position cursor on target
	* Select target

Task completion time of each device

![[Pasted image 20220821140702.png]]
> Access time with the knee-controlled lever was zero (since the device is always acquired
> Light pen use is fatiguing, since the user's arm is held in the air in front of the display

Error rates of each device
