# Gathering User Requirements
## Direct Observation
Observation techniques that directly asks the user to do something.
### Think aloud techniques
We ask the user to think aloud whatever is going through their head as they interact with the interface. However, there is observation bias in that they may act differently when they are being recorded and observed.

## Indirect Observation
A user completes a task, and we look at the logs or analytics after the fact.
### Diaries
### Interaction logs
### Web analytics
A system of tools and techniques for optimizing web usage, by *measuring*, *collecting*, *analyzing*, and *reporting web data*. Typically focuses on the number of web visitors and page views.

## Contextual Inquiry
An approach to ethnographic study where the user is expert, and the designer is apprentice. The interview happens in the user's workplace, and is usually 2-3 hours long.
* Context - See workplace and what happens
* Partnership - User and developer collaborate
* Interpretation - Observations interpreted by user and developer together
* Focus - Project focus to understand what to look for
