# Prototyping
A prototype is a mockup of a product, that is not fully developed. It's a proof of concept!
For HCI, a prototype can be in the following forms:
* Series of screen sketches
* Storyboard, i.e. a cartoon-like series of screens
* Powerpoint slide show
* Video simulating the use of a system
* Lump of wood (e.g. PalmPilot)
* Cardboard mock-up
* Piece of software with limited functionality

Prototypes allow us to evaluate and receive feedback. Team members can get on the same page, and test out ideas. Most importantly, we should be able to quickly create and discard, without spending too much money.

## Low-Fidelity Prototype
Low-fidelity prototypes uses a medium that is unlike the final medium (i.e. paper, cardboard, post-it notes). It is quick, cheap, easily changed, but is very low detail.
### Wizard of Oz Prototyping
A prototyping technique where the user thinks they are interacting with a computer, but a developer is responding to output rather than the system.

Because the developer is manipulating the system on the fly, we may not be able to replicate issues with other users. It is very taxing on the developer, who must be focused during the session.![[SmartSelect_20220601-130656_Brave.jpg]]

## High-Fidelity Prototypes
High-fidelity prototypes uses materials you would expect in the final prototype. It can be developed using existing hardware and software components.

Developers may over-promise and under-deliver, if they may not have the technical skills to turn a high-fidelity prototype into a fully functional product. It is resource-intensive, time-consuming, and may not be effective for requirements gathering (we want quick feedback).

## Conceptual Design
Transform user requirements/needs into a conceptual model. We use **metaphors**, that users are familiar with, to help the user understand the product.
