Essay Topic: Structural Factors of Myanmar's Spring Revolution (2021-2022)

## Introductory Paragraph
After the re-election of the National League for Democracy (NLD) and defeat of the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) in Myanmar's November 2020 election, rumors began surfacing of a planned military coup. On February 1st 2021, the coup, led by Min Aung Hlaing, led to the arrests of high ranking members of the NLD. They announced that another election would take place in a year's time, but did not expect the mass protests and demonstrations that resulted. Although the military coup provides a voluntarist explanation for the revolution, the military's dictatorial past and their strong grip on power, are much stronger arguments for why the Spring revolution took place.

### Myanmar's Spring Revolution
Protests and demonstrations occured after the military coup by Myanmar's military leader, Min Aung Hlaing. It details events leading up to the November 2020 election, as well as anti-coup protests and pro-military militias.

This article provides strong arguments for a voluntarist explanation of the revolution. Protests sprang up as a direct response to the military coup, and the somewhat inconsistent response to protests could have led to an increase in demonstrations. Most of the protests remained peaceful, with a few violent clashes. 

### Rohingya: A Preventable Genocide Allowed to Happen
The Rohingya genocide describes the persecution of Rohingya people in Myanmar, which increased gradually since the seizure of power by the military in 1962. Deliberate policies were put in place by the dictatorial government to drive out the Rohingya people, such as deliberate impoverishment, blocking development, and denying them public services.

The violent nature of the Rohingya genocide and the resulting humanitarian crisis plays a contributing factor in dissuading political protests. The concessions made by the military to form a democratic government, despite their violent history could be a strong structural factor.

### The Myanmar Elections
The Myanmar Elections describes the circumstances surrounding the first Myanmar election as it was about to happen. The new constitution, which had been drafted in 2008 and was set to take effect after the election, and had many provisions in place that made sure the military had significant autonomy from the ruling party.

The constitution drafted in 2008 did not put in place a proper democracy, but created somewhat of a hybrid between the two. The military was guaranteed 25% of the seats in the new legislature. Although the democracy was not perfect, it allowed citizens to have a taste of democracy, which they did not want taken away from them by the military coup.

### In the Absence of the Rule of Law: Everyday Lawyering, Dignity and Resistance in Myanmar's 'Disciplined Democracy'
This article describes the state of the legal system in Myanmar, and how lawyers navigate the legal system. It details some authoritarian actions taken by the military, such as the assassination of a prominent constitutional lawyer, U Ko Ni.

The problematic rule of law shows how the Myanmar military still had a grip on Myanmar, despite the presence of a democratic ruling party. The military is willing to act outside the authority of the ruling party, in order to further their own interests, as U Ko Ni's assassination occured while he was working on legal ways to circumvent the political power held by the military.
