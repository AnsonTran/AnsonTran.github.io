# Explaining Revolutions
Explainations for why revolutions occur usually falls into the two categories of **structurl** or **voluntarist** explanations.

## Structural Explanation

* Very difficult for any individual to alter
* Very predictable
* Focus on historical, long-term variables and trends

> Canada is a democracy because of its Protestant heritage

## Voluntarist Explanation
Under the voluntarist approach, revolutions:
* Depend on the action of a particular individual or random event
* Are unpredictable/contingent
* Almost any outcome is possible

> The Iranian revolution occured in 1979 because of President Carter's shift in foreign policy
