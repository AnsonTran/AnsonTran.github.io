# Fitzpatrick The Russian Revolution
* Lenin leaned towards an authoritarian bent, with words such as 'dictatorship', 'insurrection', and 'civil war' frequently appearing in his writing at the time
* Unlike the Mensheviks, the Bolsheviks had a clear leader in Lenin, whom some described as having less tolerance for disagreement
* Lenin believed that the core of the party should only be full-time revolutionaries, and focused on centralization, discipline, and unity within the party
* Lenin actively desired for a proletarian revolution, instead of predicting one would occur
