Social revolutions have the following characteristics:
* **Almost never result in democracies** - Violence by a militant group violates the rights of individuals, which is at the heart of democracy. Once in power, groups would not vote for their own elimination.

	* China: 69+ years
* **Humanitarian catastrophes
	* Cambodia: 25% of population between 1975-1979
	* China: 40 million people in Great Leap Forward
