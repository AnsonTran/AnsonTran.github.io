# Misery
A common belief is that mistery breeds revolution. People are placed under extreme conditions, and pushed to the point where they cannot take it any more. In this case, they would have an attitude of *nothing to lose*.

However, misery does not always lead to revolt.
* **Focus on survival** - People are focused on survival, and are averse to taking any risks. They would not have time for political activism
* **Resources for rebellion** - People are uneducated, and lack cultural capital
* **Expectations** - Enduring poverty makes their condition seem like a fact of life. It becomes difficult to seek an escape.

The mere existence of suffering is not enough to cause an insurrection. If it were, the masses would always be in revolt - Leon Trotsky
